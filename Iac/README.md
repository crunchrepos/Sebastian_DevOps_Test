# Infrastructure Setup Guide

  

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy the infrastructure using Terraform.

  

## Prerequisites

  

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

  

1. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed on your local machine.

2. AWS IAM credentials with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources.

3. AWS CLI configured with the IAM credentials.

  

## Steps

  

### 1. Clone the Repository

  

Clone the repository containing the Terraform configuration files:

  


    git clone <repository-url>
    
    cd <repository-directory>


### 2. Provide Variables

Update the `terraform.tfvars` file with your desired values for the variables used in the infrastructure setup.

hcl

Copy code

`# Update variables in terraform.tfvars file` 

### 3. Initialize Terraform

Initialize Terraform in the directory containing the configuration files:

bash

Copy code

`terraform init` 

### 4. Review Plan

Generate and review the execution plan to ensure that Terraform will create the desired infrastructure:

`terraform plan` 

### 5. Apply Changes

Apply the Terraform configuration to create the infrastructure:

`terraform apply` 

Review the changes proposed by Terraform and confirm by typing `yes` when prompted.

### 6. Verify Resources

Once Terraform has finished applying the changes, verify that the resources have been created successfully in your AWS account.

### 7. Access the Infrastructure

You can now access and use the deployed infrastructure. Here are some useful endpoints:

-   **EC2 Instance**: Use the public IP or DNS of the EC2 instance to access any services running on it.
-   **ECS Cluster**: Access the ECS cluster via the AWS Management Console or CLI to manage containerized applications.
-   **RDS Instance**: Access the RDS instance using the provided endpoint to manage the PostgreSQL database.
-   **ALB**: Access the Application Load Balancer's DNS name to distribute incoming traffic to your services.
-   **Auto Scaling Group**: Monitor and manage the Auto Scaling Group to automatically adjust capacity based on demand.

### 8. Clean Up (Optional)

If you no longer need the infrastructure, you can clean up by destroying the resources:

`terraform destroy` 

Review the plan and confirm by typing `yes` when prompted.
